      <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm Chidinma. I'm 17 years old as of August 2025; born on the 10th day of November, 2007.<br> I school at University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I'm an aspiring med student for now. I'm a purpose-driven person. Also a Christian girl<br> I just find tech very intriguing and mentally challenging and that makes me want to learn what's behind it all. I'm currently learning web development, I now understand the basics of html and css but I'm yet to learn about java script. I've heard people talk about how difficult tech is and honestly that's what makes me want to get into it. I love challengesðŸ˜µ. Well I don't really know what i'll do with the skill yet, but till then.<br> I'm kind of an introverted extrovert or an ambivert, as they call it. I just select who I let into my space and energy. It may come out as pride but I call it "protecting my peace". I love people and I'm open to friendships but I'm also aware how bad people can act at times, so que sera sera.</p>
<blockquote>
  Brainstorming is my favorite part of the process, I love to think and imagine how things can be done. I also love to write down my thoughts and ideas, it helps me organize my mind and see things clearly.

    Beauty and brains, I study both. I love to learn and grow, and I believe that knowledge is power. I also believe that beauty is not just skin deep, it's about how you carry yourself and how you treat others.
